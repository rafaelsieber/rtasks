   ```

### Pre-built Binaries

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/rtasks/releases) page for pre-built binaries for your platform.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
1. Run the application with `cargo run` or `./target/release/rtasks`
2. Use 'A' to add your first task
3. Navigate with arrow keys
4. Use Space to mark tasks as done
5. Use 'E' to edit task titles
6. Use 'D' to edit task descriptions
7. Use Delete to remove tasks
8. Press 'Q' to quit

### Command Line Mode
You can also add tasks directly from the command line without entering the interactive mode:

```bash
# Add a simple task
./target/release/rtasks -a "Fazer almo√ßo"

# Add a task with description
./target/release/rtasks -a "Comprar mantimentos" -d "Leite, p√£o, ovos e frutas"

# List all tasks
./target/release/rtasks -l

# Show help
./target/release/rtasks --help
```

#### Command Line Options

- `-a, --add <TASK>`: Add a new task and exit
- `-d, --description <DESCRIPTION>`: Description for the task (used with -a)
- `-l, --list`: List all tasks and exit
- `-h, --help`: Print help information
- `-V, --version`: Print version information

## Data Storage

Tasks are automatically saved to `~/.local/share/rtasks/tasks.json`. The directory is created automatically when you add your first task. If the directory cannot be created, it falls back to `tasks.json` in the current directory.
